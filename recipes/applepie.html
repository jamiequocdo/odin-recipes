            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>8 small Granny Smith apples, or as needed</li>
                    <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter</li>
                    <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
                    <li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>
                    <li>1/2 cup packed brown sugar</li>
                    <li>1/4 cup water</li>
                    <li>1 (9 inch) double-crust pie pastry, thawed</li>
                </ul>
            
            <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Peel and core apples, then thinly slice. Set aside.</li>
                    <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
                    <li>Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add flour 
                        and stir to form a paste; cook until fragrant, about 
                        1 to 2 minutes. Add both sugars and water; bring to a 
                        boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 3 to 5 minutes. 
                        Remove from the heat.</li>
                    <li>Press one pastry into the bottom and up the sides of a 9-inch 
                        pie pan. Roll out remaining pastry so it will overhang the pie 
                        by about 1/2 inch. Cut pastry into eight 1-inch strips.</li>
                    <li>Place sliced apples into the bottom crust, forming a slight 
                        mound. Lay four pastry strips vertically and evenly spaced 
                        over apples, using longer strips in the center and shorter 
                        strips at the edges.</li>
                    <li>Make a lattice crust: Fold the first and third strips all 
                        the way back so they're almost falling off the pie. Lay one 
                        of the unused strips perpendicularly over the second and 
                        fourth strips, then unfold the first and third strips back 
                        into their original position.</li>
                    <li>Fold the second and fourth vertical strips back. Lay one 
                        of the three unused strips perpendicularly over top. Unfold 
                        the second and fourth strips back into their original position.</li>
                    <li>Repeat Steps 6 and 7 to weave in the last two strips of pastry. 
                        Fold and trim excess dough at the edges as necessary, and pinch 
                        to secure.</li>
                    <li>Slowly and gently pour sugar-butter mixture over lattice crust, 
                        making sure it seeps over sliced apples. Brush some onto lattice, 
                        but make sure it doesn't run off the sides.</li>
                    <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce the temperature 
                        to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and continue baking until apples 
                        are soft, 35 to 45 minutes.</li>
                </ol>
