                    <li>Add the olive oil to a large soup pot and place 
                        it over medium-high heat for two minutes. Add the 
                        onion. Cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
                    </li>
                    <li>Add the ground beef to the pot. Break it apart 
                        with a wooden spoon. Cook for 6-7 minutes, until 
                        the beef is browned, stirring occasionally.
                    </li>
                    <li>Add the chili powder, cumin, sugar, tomato paste, 
                        garlic powder, salt, pepper, and optional cayenne.

                        (low to medium-low) to gently simmer the chili, uncovered, 
                        for 20-25 minutes, stirring occasionally.
