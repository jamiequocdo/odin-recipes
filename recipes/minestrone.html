                </ul>
            
            <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Warm 3 tablespoons of the olive oil in a large 
                        Dutch oven or stockpot over medium heat. Once 
                        the oil is shimmering, add the chopped onion, 
                        carrot, celery, tomato paste and a pinch of salt. 
                        Cook, stirring often, until the vegetables have 
                        softened and the onions are turning translucent, 
                        about 7 to 10 minutes.</li>
                    <li>
                        Add the seasonal vegetables, garlic, oregano and 
                        thyme. Cook until fragrant while stirring frequently, 
                        about 2 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Pour in the diced tomatoes and their juices, broth and 
                        water. Add the salt, bay leaves and red pepper flakes. 
                        Season generously with freshly ground black pepper.</li>
                    <li>Raise heat to medium-high and bring the mixture to a boil, 
                        then partially cover the pot with the lid, leaving about a 
                        1” gap for steam to escape. Reduce heat as necessary to 
                        maintain a gentle simmer.</li>
                    <li>Cook for 15 minutes, then remove the lid and add the pasta, 
                        beans and greens. Continue simmering, uncovered, for 20 
                        minutes or until the the pasta is cooked al dente and the 
                        greens are tender.</li>
                    <li>Remove the pot from the heat, then remove the bay leaves. 
                        tir in the lemon juice and remaining tablespoon of olive oil. 
                        Taste and season with more salt (I usually add about ¼ 
                        teaspoon more) and pepper until the flavors really sing. 
                        Garnish bowls of soup with grated Parmesan, if you’d like.</li>
                </ol>
